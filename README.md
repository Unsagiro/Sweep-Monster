# Clean Sweep Vacuum Cleaner & Sensor Simulator
This project is a team project, which established the control system of the cleaning robot --- Clean Sweep, and the sensor simulator which helped the Clean Sweep to take in different floor plans as its cleaning area. 

# Main Features
## Clean Sweep
It can navigate through the current floor plan to conduct cleaning cycle, for removing all the dirt on that floor plan.
- When it encounters certain obstacles, it will find a new path and keep navigating, until the whole floor plan has been visited and cleaned. 
- When it reached its dirt-carrying capacity or battery limit, it will automatically go back to the charging station and resume the unfinished cleaning work once it has been fully charged, or has been emptied.

## Sensor Simulator
As a side helper, it will take in different floor plan files and maintain them, in order to fed them to the Clean Sweep for further navigation and cleaning work.
