# Clean Sweep Robotic Vacuum Cleaner & Sensor Simulator
Cleaning Sweep Bot Simulation Project

This project is a team project, which established the control system of the cleaning robot --- Clean Sweep, and the sensor simulator which helped the Clean Sweep to take in different floor plans as its cleaning area. 

# Main Features:
Clean Sweep: Takes in different floor plans, navigate through the floor plan to conduct cleaning cycle, and remove all the dirt on this floor plan. When it encounters certain obstacles, it will find a new path and keep navigating, until the whole floor plan has been visited and cleaned.

Sensor Simulator: As a side helper, the simulator will take in the floor plan files and maintain it, in order to fed them to the Clean Sweep for further navigation and cleaning work.

# Team Efforts:
•	3 Sprints, 2-week long per sprint 
•	Writing user roles, epics, stories and prioritize them to provide the MVP at the end of the project
•	Conducting source code management by doing branching strategy and using Github repository

# Current Progress:
•	Sprint 1 done.
